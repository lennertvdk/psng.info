      <h2>Before you start</h2>
      <p>
        This document offers suggestions based on our own experience running
        university groups and on that of others in our networks. Adapt your
        approach at any point — every university environment is different. What
        follows are good suggestions, not rules. "PSNG group" therefore means
        any kind of university group you might start; it does not have to
        follow these suggestions.
      </p>
      <p>This document answers the following questions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Why should I start a PSNG group?</li>
        <li>How do I start and sustain a PSNG group? (step by step)</li>
        <li>How do I shape the content of sessions? (formats and inspiration)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="section-1">1. Why should I start a PSNG group?</h2>
      <p>
        Research on psychedelics is flourishing, but it rarely features in a
        degree programme. You don't need to be an expert to begin. You only need
        to create the space for scientific discussion. The PSNG will support you.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>The most important things first:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>JUST START.</strong> You don't need to be an expert, and you
        don't need everything planned down to the last detail. A lot only
        becomes clear once you've taken the first step.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>DON'T SET THE BAR TOO HIGH.</strong> In our experience,
        perfectionism is the biggest killer of motivation. Groups ebb and flow;
        there will be more and less participation and enthusiasm. Don't let that
        get you down — the experience you gain with every meeting is invaluable.
        Better a small event that happens than a big one you have to postpone.
        And keep an eye on your own capacity.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>GET HELP.</strong> Don't carry the responsibility alone. Find
        co-organisers and delegate tasks (social media, finding rooms, minutes).
        A useful side effect: people who take on a task identify with the group
        more quickly and tend to stay.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>THE CODE OF CONDUCT IS OUR SHARED FOUNDATION.</strong> As part
        of the network you commit to a factual, science-based way of working.
        PSNG groups are not a space for the illegal use or sale of substances,
        and they do not offer therapeutic services. Make sure the{" "}
        <Link
          to={pathFor("codeOfConduct", locale)}
          className="text-primary hover:underline"
        >
          code of conduct
        </Link>{" "}
        is read and observed by all members.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>We're on your side.</strong> Got an idea but not sure how to put
        it into words or into practice? Need contact with other groups? Write to
        us through the{" "}

      <h2 id="section-2">2. How do I start and sustain a PSNG group?</h2>

      <h3>Clarify your vision</h3>
      <p>
        Think about how you want to shape your group: what suits you, which
        kinds of events you enjoy, and what capacity you have available.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Possible thematic directions:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Education and knowledge-sharing</li>
        <li>Destigmatisation</li>
        <li>Patient advocacy</li>
        <li>Improving access (policy)</li>
        <li>Research</li>
        <li>Building communities</li>
        <li>
          Matching for research and theses (connecting students with research
          groups and supervisors — a growing need, and we're happy to help with
          introductions)
        </li>
        <li>
          Or topic-based: clinical research, use in psychotherapy, neuroscience, …
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Possible organisational directions:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Self-organised regular meetings (reading groups, films, journal clubs)
        </li>
        <li>Events with outside guests (expert talks, excursions)</li>
        <li>
          Larger projects across a term (shooting a short film, writing blog
          articles)
        </li>
        <li>
          Other projects (conference visits, breathwork, setting up a community
          space in your city, …)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>
          One thing matters: as long as the code of conduct is respected, there
          are no limits on your creativity.
        </em>
      </p>

      <h3>Find co-organisers</h3>
      <p>
        <em>Teamwork makes the dream work.</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Check whether a group already exists in your city (PSNG, uniMIND,
          Psychedelic Society) — not as competition, but as possible
          collaborators. Working together is often stronger than a second,
          parallel group.
        </li>
        <li>
          If there isn't one, create a group in the PSNG community for your city.
        </li>
        <li>
          You can use the PSNG logo, or create your own acronym and logo to
          match your vision.
        </li>
        <li>
          Actively invite people from outside the usual circles (other
          disciplines, backgrounds, perspectives): diversity makes the group
          stronger and is part of how we see ourselves.
        </li>
        <li>
          We're happy to list your group on psng.info, with or without a contact
          person. Just get in touch through our{" "}
          <Link
            to={`${home}?subject=gruppe#kontakt`}
            className="text-primary hover:underline"
          >
            contact form
          </Link>
          .
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Get over the admin hurdle</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Officially recognised university groups enjoy advantages: free room
          booking, access to mailing lists and often a budget of their own.
        </li>
        <li>
          Contact your student union (AStA) or student council. They usually
          need simple statutes and a list of members. Weigh up whether official
          status is actually necessary for your goals.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the student union refuses or hesitates: you can start without
          official status too, as an informal group or under the umbrella of an
          existing student council.
        </li>
        <li>
          Look for lecturers (in psychology, medicine, pharmacy or philosophy,
          for instance) who will back your project. That lends the group
          credibility and opens doors to university resources.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Become visible</h3>
      <p>
        <em>People can only come if they know the group exists.</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Offline:</strong> Make simple flyers with free design tools and
          hand them out in the canteen, in the library and on noticeboards. A
          stand during freshers' week is invaluable.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Online:</strong> Send those flyers to WhatsApp groups and
          student council mailing lists. Mind data protection and tone, and don't
          post pictures of substances.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Word of mouth:</strong> Talk to people about what you're doing
          and share your enthusiasm.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Your first event</h3>
      <p>
        <em>It sets the tone for how your group develops.</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Give a short introduction to the topic and present your project.</li>
        <li>
          Involve the audience: what are people interested in? What do they bring
          themselves?
        </li>
        <li>
          A first chance to share out tasks (for example, each member takes
          responsibility for one session).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Scheduling and structure</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Fixed dates:</strong> Set recurring dates early — it's more
          efficient than running a new poll every time.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Reminders:</strong> A short reminder in the group before a
          session works wonders.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Use the network:</strong> Want to stream your event or reach a
          wider audience? Have it added to the{" "}
          <Link to={`${home}#events`} className="text-primary hover:underline">
            PSNG event calendar
          </Link>
          . We're also building a network-wide lecture series you can join — just
          ask.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>A backup plan</h3>
      <p>
        If a speaker drops out at short notice, don't despair. Hold a watch party
        instead, or a discussion or sharing round on a topic of your choice. It's
        always better to offer a space for exchange than to cancel the meeting
        entirely.
      </p>

      <h3>Secure your knowledge</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Pick a platform:</strong> Use shared drives, Moodle or similar
          to store talks, papers and other material and make it accessible to
          everyone.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Onboard new members:</strong> Someone joins mid-term? A short
          welcome, access to the shared drive and a buddy to ask are enough for
          newcomers to settle in quickly.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Plan for succession:</strong> Start looking for successors to
          the founding members at least a term before you graduate, so the group
          carries on.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="section-3">3. How do I shape the content of sessions?</h2>
      <p>
        At its core, every successful group session follows a simple three-part
        structure, borrowed from the familiar shape of reflective engagement:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>1. Intention &nbsp;·&nbsp; 2. Experience &nbsp;·&nbsp; 3. Integration</strong>
      </p>

      <h3>Intention</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Arriving / check-in:</strong> a round of introductions — name,
          subject, "why are you here?"
        </li>
        <li>
          For more personal rounds: a shared meditation or breathing exercise, a
          short sharing circle, or a highlight/lowlight round.
        </li>
        <li>Talk through the content and goals of this session.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Experience</h3>
      <p>Possible formats:</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Screenings</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Show a film, piece of music or documentary</li>
        <li>Discuss it afterwards</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Experts</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Invite experts for a talk or workshop</li>
        <li>Follow with a Q&amp;A</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Papers</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Circulate a scientific paper for everyone to read</li>
        <li>One person prepares it as a presentation</li>
        <li>Open discussion</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Excursions / workshops</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Approach research groups, clinics, museums, …</li>
        <li>Go on trips together</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Reading group</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Read sections of a book chosen together, at a regular pace</li>
        <li>Discuss the chapters you've read</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Integration / self-experience</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Mindfulness exercises, meditation, breathwork</li>
        <li>Have sessions led by trained people</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Integration</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Discussion of the content (criticism, application, implications) or
          personal reflection (insights, growth).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Closing / check-out:</strong> a personal takeaway, feedback,
          and planning the next session.
        </li>
        <li>
          Where it fits, invite people to take on responsibility within the
          group — it spreads the work and builds the next generation.
        </li>
      </ul>

      </div>

      <h2 id="section-5">5. Facilitation rules</h2>
      <p>
        As a facilitator you create the setting in which everyone feels
        comfortable and can speak openly:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Everyone gets a turn.</strong> Watch out for individuals
          dominating the round. A gentle "let's hear what the others think" works
          wonders.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Separate science from personal experience.</strong> Personal
          experiences are welcome, but as a subjective perspective, not as
          general advice.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>No instructions for use, no promoting substances.</strong> PSNG
          spaces are educational spaces. If someone shares sources or goes into
          unsolicited detail about their use, steer things back kindly but
          clearly. Here you may and should interrupt.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Confidentiality.</strong> What is shared in the group stays in
          the group. No screenshots or recordings without consent.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Back to the topic.</strong> Discussions drift, and that's fine.
          A short summary brings the round back.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>You don't have to know everything.</strong> "I don't know,
          let's look it up together" is a strong answer, not a weak one.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="section-6">6. Crises &amp; difficult moments</h2>
      <p>
        Difficult situations can arise even in a well-facilitated group. You're
        not alone. When in doubt, get in touch with us at{" "}

          <strong>… someone promotes, offers or sells substances?</strong> That
          is incompatible with the code of conduct. Address it directly and stop

          your job. Listen without turning it into therapy, and point towards

          <strong>… someone shares something distressing unprompted?</strong>{" "}
          Give it a little room, but don't open up a therapy situation. "Thank
          you for sharing that. If you're looking for support with it, we'll help
          you find the right place" is appropriate.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>… you witness boundary violations or discrimination?</strong>{" "}
          Step in, name it and protect the person affected. Serious cases can be
          reported to us in confidence.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Rule of thumb:</strong> when in doubt, offer a space for exchange
        and point towards professional help, rather than letting yourself be
        pushed into a role you aren't trained for.
